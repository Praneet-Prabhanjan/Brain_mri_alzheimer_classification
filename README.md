# Brain_mri_alzheimer_classification
The World Health Organization (WHO) claims that neurological disorders provide one of the biggest risks to public health because they can impact up to
1 billion people worldwide and result in 6.8 million fatalities annually.

By utilizing deep learning techniques, this project seeks to overcome these issues by creating a novel method for the early detection of Alzheimer's from brain imaging patterns.


“ Deep Learning- Based Alzheimer's classification from Brain MRI Imaging Patterns: Revolutionizing Neurological Disorders detection“

For this Deep learning project as a part of my intership at FeynnLabs I have taken preproceessed dataset from Kaggle (Alzheimer MRI Preprocessed Dataset (128 x 128))

The Data is collected from several websites/hospitals/public repositories.
The Dataset is consists of Preprocessed MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) Images.
All the images are resized into 128 x 128 pixels.
The Dataset has four classes of images.
The Dataset is consists of total 6400 MRI images.
Class - 1: Mild Demented (896 images)
Class - 2: Moderate Demented (64 images)
Class - 3: Non Demented (3200 images)
Class - 4: Very Mild Demented (2240 images)

The main motive behind sharing this dataset is to design/develop an accurate framework or architecture for the classification of Alzheimers Disease.
